            This solution is a collection of TypeScript modules. It is the successor of an earlier project called &quot;TS&quot;. The earlier project is still available at 
            github but not longer under development. The latest release of that earlier project was compiled using the TypeScript compiler in version 1.3.0.0. By the time of 
            this writing, the current stable release of TypeScript is 1.8 and even Javascript is available in a newer version: &quot;ECMAScript 2015&quot;. The new Javascript 
            release came with some long requested features. One of them are the so called &quot;Iteration protocols&quot;. It&#39;s a set of functions, keywords and conventions 
            which make the iterator pattern (one of the GOF design patterns) an integral part of the language.
          </p>
          <p>
            The iterator pattern is also the basic pattern which drives LINQ. The earlier project used it&#39;s own implementation of the iterator pattern. Since the iterator 
            pattern is now an integral part of Javascript, that implementation became obsolet. There were also breaking changes in the TypeScript language which made it impossible 
            to compile the old code with the new 1.8 TypeScript compiler. That gave me the motivation for a complete rewrite.
          </p>
          <p>
            This projects starts with the basic infrastructure modules &quot;Utils&quot; and &quot;Exception&quot; as well as the standard LINQ operators in project 
            &quot;Linq&quot; and the two most important collections (List and Dictionary) in project &quot;Collections&quot;. The other modules which were available in the 
            earlier project will follow in later releases.

              These projects are all based on the
              <img alt="HTML Application With TypeScript" src="HTMLAppW⁬ithTypescriptTemplate_225x19.png" />
              template. I decided to use this template, because there is no library template for
            TypeScript projects.
            </p>
            <p>I removed all template files from the project directories and after that I got pretty much what I would call a library project.</p>
            <p>
              The project directories are placed inside the solution directory. (Visual Studio tries to create the project directories at the same filehierarchy level as 
              the solution directory. You have to select the target directory manually if you want to recreate the current solution setup.)
            </p>
            This setup has two adavantages. 
            <br />
            First, it is much easyer to create the code documentation with TypeDoc when the projects are placed in a common root directory. 
            <br />
            Second, you can start debugging right out of the IDE. You just have to select the &quot;Test&quot; project as your start project. 
            <br />
            <p>
              You could of course create a different setup without any problem. This setup is just the way I like to organize my source code. The &quot;Docs&quot; directory 
              as well as the &quot;Test&quot; directory are not mandatory in order to compile the source code.
            </p>
            <p>
              The solution is self contained. There is no reference to other projects outside this solution as well as there is no reference to third party libraries.

              All projects in this solution have a common TypeScript setup. They are all set to compile to the ECMAScript version &quot;ECMAScript&nbsp;6&quot;. There is also 
              no module system selected.
            </p>
            <p>
              The &quot;TS&quot; project, which is the main project from the solution, has also the &quot;Combine JavaScript output into file:&quot; selected. The path in this 
              setting is &quot;H:\PROJECT\TYPESCRIPT\TS\TS.js&quot; on my system. That is the path to the solution project 
              &quot;TS&quot; and the filename is &quot;TS.js&quot;. You may change the path or filename according to your own system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please keep in mind, that not all module system allow to compile into one file. So, if you select a module system appropriate for you own solution, you mal also 
              change the latter described setting.
            </p>
            <p>The other settings are not relevant for this solution. You may set them to whatever setting matches your own requirements best.</p>

                  The "Exception" project comprises most of the exception classes defined in this solution. The project has only one file, the "Exception.ts" file. That file 
                  contains multiple class definitions. All exceptions in this file are bound to the "TS" namespace. The 
                  &quot;TS.Exception&quot; class defined in this project is the base class of all exception classes defined in this solution. The &quot;Exception&quot; class and all derived classes have a public &quot;type&quot; property 
                  which returns the fully qualified type of the exception as string. This way you can create type specific exception handlers and overcome the poor designed 
                  exception handling implemented in Javascript, which is based on the Javascript &quot;Error&quot; object.

                  The "Linq" project comprieses the classes and interfaces which build the foundation of the LINQ implementation. The &quot;Extensions.ts&quot; file contains all the extension 
                  functions which have a counterpart in the &quot;Enumerable&quot; class in .NET.

                  In this implementation the functions are not bound to a class but are namespace functions. Some of the .NET LINQ extension functions are not implemented because 
                  of the limitations of the Javascript language.<br />
                  Some others are no original LINQ functions as defined by Microsoft but none the less very useful. A lot of 
                  the functions have a function signature which differs from the original Microsoft definition. Those differences are also founded in the limitations of the 
                  Javascript language. All the functions provide a full set of Javascript documentation comments. There you will find a description of the&nbsp; implementation specific differences. The VisualStudio IntelliSense function shows this comments while you type a function name. You should read those comments to 
                  prevent unexpected results. The following link leads to a full list of all implemented extension functions.

                <p>
                  The "Assert.ts" file contains a number of assertion functions. Functions which take one argument and return a boolean, which

                The &quot;Test&quot; project comprises the test files for the Collections, Exceptions, Linq and Utils projects. For obvious reasons there are no test files for the Docs, TS or Test project itself. The test file names follow a common conventions. Each file name starts with the project name 
                which hosts the classes or functions which get tested in the current test. Separated by an underscore follows the class name the test belongs to. In case the test is designed to test functions which are not bound to a class (namespace functions) there won&#39;t be a class name. After that follows the ending &#39;test.ts&quot; or &quot;test_plain.js&quot; which is also separated by an underscore. The files which end on &quot;test.ts&quot; are QUnit tests written in TypeScript. Those which end on &quot;test_plain.js&quot; are QUnit tests written in plain Javascript. The tests in plain Javascript became necessary because some tests couldn&#39;t be described in TypeScript.
                Each unit test has a corresponding HTML file wich is used to start the test.</p>
